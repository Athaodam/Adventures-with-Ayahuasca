Since the late 1990s, the Amazonian psychoactive beverage ayahuasca has grown increasingly common throughout the world. Spurred by interest in Indigenous Amazonian groups, New Age spiritual practices, and the exoticizing travel writing, ayahuasca has attained the status of “The Drug of Choice for the Age of Kale,” according to a recent article in The New Yorker.[^ref1] Despite its global popularity, ayahuasca’s ingredients and components, ritual usage, and spiritual and medicinal effects remain highly dynamic and contested. 

## Ayahuasca: A plant or a brew?

Although many associate ayahuasca with a particular species of plant, it actually refers to a group of Indigenous psychoactive brews made by boiling a combination of species found in certain regions of Amazonia. The name ayahuasca is a compound word in the Quechua language: aya refers to “soul, ancestors, or dead persons” while wasca refers to “vine or rope.” Popular translations of the name allude to “vine of the soul,” while skeptics suggest “rope of death.”[^ref2] However, Ayahuasca is known by many names such as natema, hoasca, daime, yagé, or yajé among groups living in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil.

On a pharmacological level, ayahuasca harnesses the chemical effects caused by the mixture of plants that contain β-carboline type alkaloids (such as harmine and tetrahydroharmine) and Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to produce a hallucinogenic state within the consumer.[^ref3] There are many traditions associated with the preparation and imbibing of the decoction due to its ubiquity amongst cultures throughout the Amazon basin and Andean highlands. Boiling and steeping together the vines of Banisteriopsis caapi (Malpighiaceae) and the leaves of Psychotria viridis (Rubiaceae) is most common.[^ref4] However, there are some recipes which do not contain any Psychotria viridis and opt for other plants which contain DMT such as Diplopterys cabrerana (Malpighiaceae).

Additionally, exact recipes are often closely guarded by Indigenous knowledge keepers known as ayahuasqueros or vegetalistas, and precise measurements of the ingredients are not always recorded. Beyond the variability of the recipes, naming the plant species used in ayahuasca decoctions is at times complicated by vernacular naming traditions. Different Indigenous groups classify plants according to different criteria (leaf shape/size/breadth/flowering vs. non-flowering, the effects of the plant on the human body, the color of the decoction made from the plant, as well as the guardian spirits associated with the plant).[^ref5] These unique classification systems at times identify the same plant species as several different species. These “different” species are used to create brews with varying strength and purpose.[^ref6]
