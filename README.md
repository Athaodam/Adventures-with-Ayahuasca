Since the late 1990s, the Amazonian psychoactive beverage ayahuasca has grown increasingly common throughout the world. Spurred by interest in Indigenous Amazonian groups, New Age spiritual practices, and the exoticizing travel writing, ayahuasca has attained the status of “The Drug of Choice for the Age of Kale,” according to a recent article in The New Yorker.[^ref1] Despite its global popularity, ayahuasca’s ingredients and components, ritual usage, and spiritual and medicinal effects remain highly dynamic and contested. 

## Ayahuasca: A plant or a brew?

Although many associate ayahuasca with a particular species of plant, it actually refers to a group of Indigenous psychoactive brews made by boiling a combination of species found in certain regions of Amazonia. The name ayahuasca is a compound word in the Quechua language: aya refers to “soul, ancestors, or dead persons” while wasca refers to “vine or rope.” Popular translations of the name allude to “vine of the soul,” while skeptics suggest “rope of death.”[^ref2] However, Ayahuasca is known by many names such as natema, hoasca, daime, yagé, or yajé among groups living in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil.

On a pharmacological level, ayahuasca harnesses the chemical effects caused by the mixture of plants that contain _β-carboline_ type alkaloids (such as harmine and tetrahydroharmine) and _Dimethyltryptamine_ (DMT) to produce a hallucinogenic state within the consumer.[^ref3] There are many traditions associated with the preparation and imbibing of the decoction due to its ubiquity amongst cultures throughout the Amazon basin and Andean highlands. Boiling and steeping together the vines of _Banisteriopsis caapi_ (Malpighiaceae) and the leaves of Psychotria viridis (Rubiaceae) is most common.[^ref4] However, there are some recipes which do not contain any Psychotria viridis and opt for other plants which contain DMT such as Diplopterys cabrerana (Malpighiaceae).

Additionally, exact recipes are often closely guarded by Indigenous knowledge keepers known as ayahuasqueros or vegetalistas, and precise measurements of the ingredients are not always recorded. Beyond the variability of the recipes, naming the plant species used in ayahuasca decoctions is at times complicated by vernacular naming traditions. Different Indigenous groups classify plants according to different criteria (leaf shape/size/breadth/flowering vs. non-flowering, the effects of the plant on the human body, the color of the decoction made from the plant, as well as the guardian spirits associated with the plant).[^ref5] These unique classification systems at times identify the same plant species as several different species. These “different” species are used to create brews with varying strength and purpose.[^ref6]

## Ayahuasca in Practice

The use of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis dates back at least one thousand years. A preserved ritual bundle containing snuff paraphernalia, dried plant remains, pouches, and textiles was excavated at the Cueva del Chilena rock structure in the Sora Valley in Bolivia, associated with the ancient Tiwanaku state. Chemical analysis conducted on harmine and DMT residue indicates that  Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis were likely present in the bundle. It is not known how these materials were taken into the body (snuff plates and spatulas were discovered in the bundle so the plants were possibly inhaled directly) but it is possible that the two plants were combined together even then to create an early ayahuasca decoction.[^ref7]

Consuming ayahuasca produces a roughly four hour long period of altered consciousness. During this time, practitioners experience otherworldly visuals and fluctuations in conceptions of reality and selfhood. Most Indigenous groups of the Amazon basin understand the world as a series of interlocking human and nonhuman persons, both visible and invisible.[^ref8] By entering the “ayahuasca world,” a liminal meeting place with more-than-human beings, Indigenous participants in the ritual are able to better visualize the forces at work around them.[^ref9] Such insight is used to treat physical ailments, address mental health concerns, and provide spiritual guidance. In these Amazonian communities, ayahuasca is central to religious, healing, and initiation ceremonies as a form of traditional medicine and psychiatry.[^ref10]  

## Representing Ayahuasca with the Senses

While conducting his groundbreaking research on ayahuasca rituals amongst the mestizo population in the Peruvian Amazon, anthropologist Luis Eduardo Luna encountered the curandero Pablo Amaringo. Wanting to know more about Amaringo’s experiences with the brew, Luna provided him with paper and tempera paints and asked him to draw his visions. For Amaringo, the visual was a key component in ayahuasca’s efficacy. “The Spirits don’t talk,” he explains, “but express themselves through images.” Full of bright colors, elaborate patterns, and fantastical scenes, Amaringo’s paintings both attempt to reproduce the effects of ayahuasca and point to the knowledge and wisdom derived from the rituals. Furthermore, according to Amaringo, the brew transformed him into an artist by teaching him how to see and understand colors. In this example, Amaringo represents the corpus of Indigenous botanical knowledge and the ways practitioners might access that knowledge through ayahuasca, fasting, and chanting. 

For the <span ve-entity eid="Q36411">Shipibo people</span> of modern day Peru, ayahuasca rituals likewise revolve around visualizing the unseen. According to Shipibo history, in ancient times, everything in the world -- water, plants, earth, humans, etc. -- was once covered with intricate patterns that expressed the fundamental nature of creation through design. As time passed, this ubiquitous patterning was lost. Through the transcendent hallucinations of ayahuasca, though, Shipibo artists could once again have access to sacred patterns. The Shipibo people are unique in that the majority of these artists and practitioners were female. By reproducing such patterns in pottery and textiles, these women practiced therapy and healing born out of the knowledge of the interconnectedness of the universe.

## Ethnobotanical Encounters 
## Ayahuasca's Global Trip 
Today, many in the West are most familiar with ayahuasca not through Indigenous knowledge systems and practices, but through its incorporation into New Age spiritualism. Following in the footsteps of Americans like Burroughs, by the late twentieth century westerners were flocking to Amazonia in search of an authentic experience with the brew. So profitable was this new fascination with the hallucinogen, that an entire industry of ayahuasca tourism began to flourish in the Amazon basin. As a result, ayahuasca rituals were westernized to focus on self-exploration and emotional healing under the leadership of new “gringo shamans” and exported in vast networks, particularly in the United States and Canada, but also through Europe, Africa, and Asia.[^ref29]

Scholars have debated at length about the contemporary global usage of ayahuasca. On the one hand, ayahuasca tourism highlights the legacies of extractive colonialism as non-Indigenous peoples exploit Indigenous knowledge and belief systems and adapt them for their own benefit. In the case of ayahuasca, this often involves idealizing and stereotyping real Indigenous shamans living in the modern world. [^ref30]  On the other hand, ayahuasca has provided Indigenous people with an economic tool to engage with the wider globe, while at the same time ensuring the persistence of practices that were threatened by Christianizing colonialism. [^ref31]

In truth, ayahuasca rituals have always been dynamic and multiple, differing between ethnic groups in Amazonia and evolving over time. In Peru, for example, the mestizo population developed a set of practices called _Vegetalismo_, which was inflected by both Catholicism and traditional Indigenous knowledges. Vegetalistas consider the plants that form the ayahuasca brew to be “teachers” capable of imparting specialized knowledge to humans. Likewise, a Brazilian minister raised in an ethnically diverse rubber boom town founded the syncretic church of _Santo Daime_ based on Catholicism, African animism, and Indigenous vegetalismo, which uses ayahuasca extensively in its rituals. _Santo Daime_ itself spread globally, with churches in the United States, Canada, and Europe.                              

The question then becomes, _who_, if anyone, _owns_ ayahuasca? In 1986, American Loren Miller tried to patent ayahuasca plant. Back in the late 1970s, this pharmacologist had developed a cultivar in Hawaii of Banisteriopsis caapi. He named his patented plants “Da Vine” and founded a company to study its potential benefits. [^ref32] Miller’s actions are best described as biopiracy and were denounced by the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) in 1994.                                

The “Da Vine” patent was eventually overturned, but not because the courts recognized the COICA’s claims to their own culture.[^ref33] Rather, a herbarium specimen from the Field Museum in Chicago demonstrated that Miller’s unique plant had in fact been cultivated on U.S. soil before he submitted his patent. In the end, this seemingly simple botanical artifact —a pressed and dried plant with a descriptive label attached to a cardboard— defined what ayahuasca meant in the United States.
